android app

This android app acts as a clicker for any classroom.  Teachers have the ability to ask questions to the classroom, and they can answer it real time by pressing the answer they think is correct on their phone.  Teachers add questions to the website and throughout their lecture they can ask their students to answer the specified question.  This allows the teacher to know how many students are following along.  It gives each students answer, and can give an average of the amount of students that correctly answer each question.  This will allow teachers to better understand the abilities of their students, and if they need to spend more or less time on subjects.
